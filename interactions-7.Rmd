## What are interactions?
- When the effect of one predictor depends on the levels of another

##Example
- Y is a measure of health problems that we are predicting from measures of stress (X) and from social support (Z) 
- Suppose the relationship between stress and health depends on the level of social support
- This would be an interaction – the relationship between one predictor (stress) and the outcome (health) varies as a function of another predictor (social support).   


## How can we visualize this association?

<img src="/Users/Jackson/Box Sync/5067 Regression Spring/regression/3d.png" width="750" height="550"/>


## 

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}XZ $$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readr)
Multipleregression <- read.csv("Multipleregression.csv")
Multipleregression$Support.r <- (17.36 - Multipleregression$Support)/3
mr.model <- lm(Stress ~ Support.r* Anxiety, data = Multipleregression)
library(visreg)
visreg2d(mr.model,"Support.r", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```

## How can we visualize this association?  

- 2d?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
Multipleregression$Anxiety.c <- scale(Multipleregression$Anxiety, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
Multipleregression$Support.c <- scale(Multipleregression$Support.r, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
Multipleregression$Support.c <- as.numeric(Multipleregression$Support.c)
Multipleregression$Anxiety.c <- as.numeric(Multipleregression$Anxiety.c)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

mr.model.c <- lm(Stress ~ Support.c* Anxiety.c, data = Multipleregression)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(pequod)
int.model <- lmres(Stress ~ Support.c* Anxiety.c, data = Multipleregression)
slope.1 <- simpleSlope(int.model, pred="Support.c", mod1="Anxiety.c")
PlotSlope(slope.1)

```

## Goals for today
- interpretation
- centering
- plotting

## 
$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}XZ $$

- main effects and interaction effects
- lower order terms and higher order term  
<br>
<br>
- higher order/interaction terms are created through multiplication

## moderator variables

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}XZ $$
$\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X$ at different levels of Z  
<br>
$\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}Z$ at different levels of X


```{r, echo = FALSE}
visreg2d(mr.model,"Support.r", "Anxiety", plot.type = "persp")

```


## interpretation

- With an interaction term, the main effects are now interpreted as regression of Y on X when Z = 0. 

- called conditional effects

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}XZ $$

-  Need to get rid of the other X in the model, having z at zero is the only way to meaningfully interpert  

-  0 is often meaningless in social science work  

## centering

- "de-mean" your variable to 0  
- remember, a linear transformation does not change association  
- only changes interpretation (i.e. average value) for some coefficients

```{r, eval = FALSE}

#dataset$X.c <- scale(dataset$X, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)

```

## centering

- without interactions, what changes if we center? 

- with interactios, what changes if we center? 

## interpret regression coeffificents

1. simple linear regression
2. dummy codes/effect codes
3. multiple regression
4. interactions (conditional effects)

## plotting helps us interpret the association
- we could plot 3d, but that works best when you have 2 variables
- simpler to plot to 2d relationship
- plot "simple slopes" at different values of moderator
- typically a small, medium and large value
- plus minus SD, clinicial cutoffs, meaningful divisions (degrees)

## 

```{r, echo =FALSE}
set.seed(1)
x1 <- runif(100, 0, 1)
x2 <- sample(1:10, 100, TRUE)/10
y <- 1 + 2 * x1 + 3 * x2 + 4 * x1 * x2 + rnorm(100)
m <- lm(y ~ x1 * x2)
m2 <- lm(y ~ x1 * factor(x2))
nx <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 10)
z <- outer(nx, nx, FUN = function(a, b) predict(m, data.frame(x1 = a, x2 = b)))
persp(nx, nx, z, theta = 45, phi = 10, shade = 0.75, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2", 
    zlab = "y")
```


## simple slopes with no interaction term
- what is the equation for Y on X at differnt levels of Z? 

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z  $$

$$ \hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}Z) + b_{1}X   $$

$$ \hat{Y} = (1.2 + .3Z) + .6X   $$
$\hat{Y} = 1.8 + .6X$ @ Z = 2        
<br>
$\hat{Y} = 1.2 + .6X$ @ Z = 0  
<br>
$\hat{Y} = .8 + .6X$ @ Z = -2

## simple slopes with interaction term

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}XZ $$

$$ \hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}Z) + (b_{1} + b_{3}Z)X $$

## simple slopes with interaction term
$$ \hat{Y} = 1.2 + .6X + .3Z + .15XZ $$
$$ \hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}Z) + (b_{1} + b_{3}Z)X $$

$$ \hat{Y} = (1.2 + .3Z) + (.6 + .15Z)X $$
$\hat{Y} = .3 + .15X$ @ -3  
<br>
$\hat{Y} = 1.2 + .6X$ @ 0  
<br>
$\hat{Y} = 2.1 + 1.05X$ @ 3  

## To interpret output, you need to look at graphs
- a priori hypotheses not always correct
- form of interaction meaningful in addition to whether there is an interaction
- cannot easily tell by just looking at coefficients
- simple slopes analyses can yeild additional hypothesis tests

## errata 

- covariates?   
    + do you need to center these? 
- standardizing variables
    + must compute yourself!!! 
    + reason is the interaction term is the cross product of standardized scores, not the standardized cross product  
- group variables? 

## nominal variables and interactions

- How is GPA related to starting salary for Engineering, Business and Psych majors?

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D_{1} + b_{2}D_{2} + b_{3}GPA  $$
```{r}
contr.treatment(3)
##  psych = 1, business = 2 engineering = 3
```
- what does this graph look like? 

## nominal variables and interactions

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D_{1} + b_{2}D_{2} + b_{3}GPA + b_{4}(D_{1} * GPA) + b_{5}(D_{2} * GPA)$$  

- how do I interpret these terms? 
- what would this graph look like? 

## nominal variables and interactions
$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}D_{1} + b_{2}D_{2} + b_{3}GPA + b_{4}(D_{1} * GPA) + b_{5}(D_{2} * GPA)  $$

- what are the simple regression equations for each group?
<br>
psych: $\hat{Y} = b_{0} +  b_{3}GPA$  
business: $\hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{1}) + (b_{3} + b_{4})GPA$  
engineering: $\hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}) + (b_{3} + b_{5})GPA$  

## simple slopes tests
- what if i wanted the simple slope of business?   
- what if i wanted to test whether the slopes of buisness and engineering were different?   
- what if I wanted to test the slope to the grand mean rather than to psych? what coefficients change (and what stay the same) in this case?

## 2-way and higher order interactions

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}W + b_{4}XZ + b_{5}XW + b_{6}ZW + b_{7}XZW $$

## 4 way? 

$$ \hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}Z + b_{3}W + b_{4}Q + b_{5}XW + b_{6}ZW + b_{7}XZ + b_{8}QX$$
$$+ b_{9}QZ + b_{10}QW + b_{11}XZQ + b_{12}XZW + b_{13}XWQ + b_{14}ZWQ + b_{15}XZWQ  $$

## if you must 3-way
- easier to do with a nominal moderating variable  
- e.g., old vs young, tx vs control
- then you graph 2 2-way interactions to interpret

## post hoc analyses

- are the simple slopes different from 0? 
- is a pair of simple slopes different from one another? 
- what is the magnitude of the interaction? 

## are the simple slopes different from 0? 
Remember that the slope at any particular value is a combination of both b1 and b3 
$$ \hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}Z) + (b_{1} + b_{3}Z)X $$
$$ se_{b@z} = \sqrt{se_{b1}^2 + (2 * Z * cov_{b1b3})+ (Z^2 se_{b3}^2)}$$
- covariance is for the coefficients
```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(vcov(mr.model.c))

```

## are the simple slopes different from 0? 

$$ \hat{Y} = (b_{0} + b_{2}Z) + (b_{1} + b_{3}Z)X $$
$$ t = \frac{(b_{1} + b_{3}Z)}{se_{b@z}}$$
df = n-p-1

## Do the slopes of a pair of simple slopes differ from one another?

- The interaction tests whether the slope 1 SD above differs from 1 SD below  
- What about for categorical predictors?  

## what is the magnitude of the interaction? 


## graphing

- predict and do by hand
- pequod
- sjPlot
- reghelper (in development), others.. 


## 

```{r}
library(pequod)
int.model <- lmres(Stress ~ Support.c* Anxiety.c, data = Multipleregression)
slope.1 <- simpleSlope(int.model, pred="Support.c", mod1="Anxiety.c")
PlotSlope(slope.1)
```


## 
```{r}
library(sjPlot)
sjp.int(mr.model.c, 
        type = "eff",
        mdrt.values = "meansd",
        swap.pred = TRUE)
```


## 
```{r}
support.c.values <- range(Multipleregression$Support.c)
anxiety.c.values <- c(-sd(Multipleregression$Anxiety.c), 0,
sd(Multipleregression$Support.c))
plot.data <- expand.grid(Support.c = support.c.values, Anxiety.c = anxiety.c.values)
plot.data
```

##  

```{r}
plot.data$Stress <- predict(mr.model.c, newdata=plot.data) 
plot.data$Anxiety.c <- factor(plot.data$Anxiety.c, labels = c("-1SD", "Mean", "+1SD"))
plot.data
```

## 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(plot.data, aes(x=Support.c, y = Stress, color=Anxiety.c))+
ggtitle("Impact of Support on Stress, moderated by Anxiety") + geom_line()+
scale_x_continuous("Support Levels (centered)")+ scale_y_continuous("Stress Levels")+
scale_color_discrete("Anxiety")+ theme_bw()
```


## errata mark II

- non linear associations can masquerade as interactions
- should test whether polynomial interactions serve as a more simplistic explanation

## polynomial regression 
- contain a series of higher order function for a single variable  
<br>
Linear $\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X$  
<br>
Quadratic $\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}X^2$    
<br>
Cubic $\hat{Y} = b_{0} + b_{1}X + b_{2}X^2 + b_{3}X^3$  


## 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mtcars2 <- read.csv("mtcars2.csv")
quad <- lm(mpg ~ hp + I(hp^2), data = mtcars2)
prd <- data.frame(hp = seq(from = range(mtcars2$hp)[1], to = range(mtcars2$hp)[2], length.out = 100))
err <- predict(quad, newdata = prd, se.fit = TRUE)

prd$lci <- err$fit - 1.96 * err$se.fit
prd$fit <- err$fit
prd$uci <- err$fit + 1.96 * err$se.fit

ggplot(prd, aes(x = hp, y = fit)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(aes(ymin = lci, ymax = uci), stat = "identity") +
  geom_point(data = mtcars2, aes(x = hp, y = mpg))
```


## 

```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(quad)
```


## when to fit?
- theory
- scatter plots
- residual plot
- safeguard

## interpretation of coefficients
- intercept is predicted value when x = 0
- The b1 coefficient is the tangent to the curve when X=0.     + rate of change when x = 0  
    + thus important to center

```{r}
mtcars2$hp.c <- scale(mtcars2$hp, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
mtcars2$hp.c <- as.numeric(mtcars2$hp.c)
quad.c <- lm(mpg ~ hp.c + I(hp.c^2), data = mtcars2)
tidy(quad.c)
```

## 
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
prd.c <- data.frame(hp.c = seq(from = range(mtcars2$hp.c)[1], to = range(mtcars2$hp.c)[2], length.out = 100))

err.c <- predict(quad.c, prd.c, se.fit = TRUE)

prd.c$lci <- err.c$fit - 1.96 * err$se.fit
prd.c$fit <- err.c$fit
prd.c$uci <- err.c$fit + 1.96 * err$se.fit

ggplot(prd.c, aes(x = hp.c, y = fit)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(aes(ymin = lci, ymax = uci), stat = "identity") +
  geom_point(data = mtcars2, aes(x = hp.c, y = mpg))
```


## 
- The b2 coefficient is the acceleration 
- More specifically, 2*b2 is the acceleration – the rate of change in b1 for a 1-unit change in X   

<br>
b1+2*b2X = slope of tangent line at a particular value of X

```{r}
 -0.0898514747 + 2*0.0004208156*106.75
```

```{r}
 -0.0898514747 + 2*0.0004208156*180
```
