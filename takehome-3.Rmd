All take home projects are **INDEPENDENT** projects; do not share code or answers.   

Please use the th.project.3 dataset to answer the questions below. These data were from a study where physical health was predicted by a happyness measure, socioeconomic status, number of close friends, and a 16 week mood intervention where here was a waitlist control group (coded 0), a positive self affirmation intervention group (1) and a mediation group (2). 

1. Calculate the semi-partial and a partial correlation for health and friends, controlling for SES and happiness using a series of multiple regression analyses (ie do not use a function for semi-partial and partial correlations). 

2. Perform a multiple regression where Health is regressed on (predicted by) friends, SES and happiness. Interpret each regresion coefficient. 

3. What is similar and what is different between the partial correlation in #1 and the friends regression coefficient in #2? 

4. Graph the (2-d) relationship between health and happiness as found in the above regression. Make sure the association controls for the remaining variables in the model. Include data points in your graph and a confidence band. 

5. Describe why the confidence band looks like a bow tie in the above graph. 

6. For the above regression, calculate variance explained using the anova table and interpret the residual standard error 

7. Add the group variable mood.group into the regression model from #2. 
  a) Interpret the coefficients
  b) Is there a significant increase in variance explained compared to the initial regression in #2? If so, what is the estimate? 
  c) Recode the group contrasts into effect coding (-1,0 and 1). Rerun the model. Interpret each regression coefficient including the intercept. 
  d) For the model you ran in c, is the change in variance explained different from the change in variance explained from question 7b? Why or why not?
